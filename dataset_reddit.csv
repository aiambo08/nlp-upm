This is a huge issue that's not going to go away on its own, especially now that Republicans control congress and most state legislatures. I live in Washington State. We have committed to mail in/drop box voting across the state. All registered voters automatically have ballots mailed to their homes a few weeks before election day. We are able to take our time filling out our ballots, and once we've decided on all candidates and initiatives we can either mail ballots in, or drop them off at drop boxes that are accessible 24/7. Essentially I never have to wait in line or show my ID to anyone throughout the entire process. When I hear about states that only allow people to vote on election day it makes me furious. I can't understand how it's okay to make people in some states stand in line for up to 4 hours while I don't have to be inconvenienced in any way. We are voting in the same presidential election, so why should it be easier for me than for you?! Is this not a violation of people's rights when we are unnecessarily obstructing their ability to vote? We know mail-in early voting is a seamless, functional way to conduct elections, so why can't it be the standard across the country? I'm not a constitutional scholar or lawyer, but in my opinion voter suppression seems like a violation of the 14th amendment. When we make it harder for some people to vote aren't we failing to offer equal rights and protection to every citizen? Is there any chance of progress being made on this issue now that Republicans control the federal and state governments?"

I am a die hard football fan. My entire life I have watched every game I possibly could. This is the first year I've regularly been at home with a competitive evening game on and said ""nah, I'll watch Netflix instead"". Part of it to me, I think, is that virtually everything I hear about the NFL is negative and unrelated to the parts of the sport I like. I don't think that's an exaggeration. Kaepernick, celebration rules, officiating errors, the disciplinary policy, concussions, it feels like the NFL continually holds a negative news cycle. Compare that to the NBA, where the story all year was whether anyone could stop Steph, whether the Cavs could mesh well enough to win the finals, whether Toronto was for real, and etc. I would much prefer to hear tomorrow's sports radio cycle be ""What's wrong with Aaron Rodgers"" and ""Can the Steelers survive without Ben"" and all that fun stuff which is related to the sport I like to watch. But I know that before we get to those things I'm going to have to hear extensive discussion about the celebration rule, about Kaepernick's protest, about whether some concussed player was properly treated in some game, and a growing list of regular crap. It just makes it less and less fun to be a fan."

The unfortunate truth is that this deal, while positive, will not make a lick of difference in the long run. We need to dramatically reduce emissions far more than the large governments are offering, and we need to do it far faster than they're offering. Not just that, we need to be taking approaches which actively restore the environment, reducing the acidity of the seas, the carbon dioxide in the air, the deforestation for cattle and the methane they produce, the desertification of fertile land, the privatisation of water in vital areas, the rampant destruction of at least eleven species a day. If we do not do any of these things within the next few years, I cannot stress enough that humanity won't survive. I hate to go all power-to-the-people on you, but we need to stop waiting for the multinational conglomerates of the world to suddenly grow hearts and consciences. They won't, because it defies Capitalism to do anything other than seek profit at the expense of everyone and everything. So they must be forced. The governments won't do it, so the people must."

For instance, it is also possible to imagine a world free of human sin and free will, but where tragedy like earthquakes, cancer, and birth defects happen. In this world, there would be no murder or theft, but there would STILL be death and suffering. But it is possible to image a world where sin and free will exists, but suffering is greatly reduced. For instance, murder, theft, rape, still happen, even to innocent people. HOWEVER, what does not happen is tsunamis, cancer, birth defects, SIDS, epilepsy, killer bee attacks, heart attacks, etc. I feel like a defense of suffering in the free will argument ignores this second scenario and disregards suffering clearly unrelated to sin."

I just decided to login to Neighbourly to see if it has grown much since i initially signed up, it's still rubbish. I was about to uninstall when to my horror I found a massive user accessible list of full names and home addresses of everyone in my area (probably about 1000 names). I went through and found a few of my tech savvy friends and sure enough it had their correct home addresses listed, and sure enough they did not realise. This is a disgustingly flippant use of private information which is extremely dangerous and Fairfax Media knows better. Someone with a very basic knowledge of computers could easily scrape the entire Neighbourly database (I'm sure many already have) in a matter of seconds, from anywhere in the world (you don't even need to search for names, it's all just displayed in a huge list!!). This is personal information that should **never** be publicly available online. Home address is an extremely common identity check question used by banks, email providers etc to prove you are you because no stranger should ever no it. Does everyone else agree that in this day and age it is completely unacceptable for a company like Fairfax to be so irresponsible with their use of private information? What can be done to make Neighbourly remove this information by default? If you at any time signed up to Neighbourly realise that your home address linked to your full name is now very likely on a huge database floating around shady corners of the internet and it is no longer safe to assume it is private, even if you delete your Neighbourly account, which I am sure you will all be doing."

No FEMA help, none of them had insurance, which wouldn't matter if they did because they'll call it an act of God and won't pay. If it wasn't for the fact that part of the flooding happened at the Greenbrier resort two weeks before the PGA was supposed to play, no one would know anything about it. Which, by the way, was 90% of the coverage. ""Look, this billionaires golf course is under water...the PGA is supposed to play there. Bubba Watson sent out pictures...what a shame, back to you.""

I saw someone I thought looked vaguely familiar who was wearing maroon, so I assumed she worked there and asked her where something was. She did not work there. She works at my job and I believe she's a manager. She kinda just pointed to her shirt and that's when I noticed the name of the fast food restaurant on her shirt.

Very simply put stem cells are like amazing brand new cells that can be placed where an injury occurred and take the form of new cells that are needed to replace and repair the injured dead and dying cells. In other more tolerable countries chronic illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis are being cured ( you can google that yourself and read proper real medical results, for those of you wanting sources) with fetal stem cells. Believe me if I had the money i'd be over there having stem cells rid my body of M.S.

Voting is still 95 days away and a lot can happen in between then. 2) I feel that to really win this election, Trump and his movement need to be crushed. For some perspective, in 1964, Lyndon Baines Johnson landed one of the most massive defeats in US history against Barry Goldwater and ushered in a lot of progressive policies. Fast forward 16 years, and we have a candidate a lot like Barry Goldwater except worse winning an even larger landslide. Now fast forward to today, and we have Trump who I would argue is the final form of Barry Goldwater's original Bastard Child. Trump needs to lose this election in a landslide."

So assuming the wall is 100% effective then after 7 years it would have prevented around 3,500,000 illegals from entering the US. That's around $14,000 per immigrant you keep out. Finally the Centre for Immigration studies estimates a net government deficit of $2700 per illegal household, assuming that is 2 people then you're looking at spending $14000 to prevent a deficit of $1350, given the on-going cost of maintaining the 100% effective wall, you are looking at 21 years before breaking even assuming nothing else changes."

Hey r/Christianity, I served at a youth retreat as part of the staff this past weekend. It was... interesting to say the least. A bit of background: There is this girl in our church's youth group that supposedly has a ""demon"" named ""Lucy"" inside her. For the past 3 years, she has ""manifested"" in a spiritual attack at every single YG retreat (they are twice a year). It has gotten to the point where parents won't send their children to the retreat because of these things happening. Her manifestations are pretty much always the same thing: Lots of screaming, squirming around, maniacal laughter, and yelling curse words. She manifested again this past weekend and disrupted the entire retreat. The staff had to stay up til 3 to either intercede in prayer OR to take care of the kids -- some were terrified and others were so used to these incidents that they weren't phased. Personally, I'm skeptical. There was one incident where she began to show symptoms of manifestations at a Friday service. I happened to be in charge that night and, as part of an incident, went against the ""standard procedure"" that our youth pastor follows. Usually, most of the staff gathers around her to pray and prevent her from hurting herself. Eventually, she's moved to a separate room and the ""deliverance"" is done there. The problem I have with this procedure is that everyone's attention is on her. At the particular Friday service, I decided to see what happened if we didn't put the attention on her. Instead of getting all the staff and making a big deal out of it, we just left her to seek attention. We pulled all of the kids out of the sanctuary and into rooms for small group sessions. A couple staff stayed in the back of the room to make sure she didn't hurt herself. Guess what? No manifestation! Everyone was happy and we all got to go home on time. The problem is, the youth pastor is convinced that it's real. I think he knows better than I do, but I'm also pretty sure that she's faking it. I don't want to hurt her by calling her fake, but I think it's bad for the youth group as a whole if she were to be allowed to continue this charade. How can I know for sure? What should I do? TL;DR - A girl in youth group is manifesting demonic possession. I think it's fake. Youth Pastor thinks it's real. What do I do?"

There was this one kid who looked really beefed up, and so I thought that he was really big on working out. We chatted, and he said he was from [ghetto school in rough neighborhood], so it made sense to me. Maybe he was in a gang? He was already tatted up. Assembly that morning, the same kid was at the front next to the principal like he was going to make an announcement, except he was wearing a uniform. He was actually a cop.

So I didn't have a good sleep the night before, and during dinner before the rehearsal my friends decided to have vegetarian cuisine for dinner, food that I'm not really used to having. I don't know it this is connected to what will happen next, but it probably is. Basically my body was experiencing a tired-but-not-sleepy feeling,my mind was a little hazy, and I had a practice that night. Felt very mild discomfort in my stomach but I brushed it off. We started practising the first song. As we were playing, my stomach felt more and more uncomfortable. The music was getting a little droney, I was fumbling my lines, and then a brilliant idea came into my head: I should let off a fart to release the mild discomfort I'm experiencing now, and then I'll play better. No one is going to hear it anyway with all the music. You know the age-old proverb, ""When you gamble on a fart, nobody wins""? It was this rehearsal where I learned its true meaning. Almost as instantaneously as I sharted, a dank whiff filled the stage area. My underwear felt uncomfortably heavy and moist. My stomach grumbled even more. I soon saw a slight confused grimace on my bassist's face. It then dawned on me what sin I have committed. I soon excused myself from the band mid-song and rushed down to the toilet. Safe to say, my underwear was ruined. Luckily it was a relatively light shart, none of my excrement seeped through the underwear or spilled outside to touch my pants (or so I hoped). I cleared what's left in the bowels (it was *the* smelliest dump I ever took, a weird aromatic mixture of spices and whatever black magic vegetarian chefs use in their trade), disposed my underwear, put my pants back on and went commando. As I returned to my band, the singer asked if everything was okay. I told him yeah, I've just had a mild (read: massive) stomachache to handle. He nodded and said, ""yeah, we noticed a fart smell earlier in the song"". I played it cool. Yep, it was just a fart. Nothing worse than that. ^^^They ^^^probably ^^^knew. Luckily this didn't happen during an actual live performance. It's still a little embarrassing for me to recount though"

Friday was the last day of finals so I asked my friend (lets call her Maddy) if she wanted to celebrate by getting tequila and getting smashed. She says yes, so I go over to her place around 8. Apparently she's having more people over and this annoys me because I thought it was just her and I. I want to be pissed about it, but I dont allow myself to do so and I just start drinking to lighten my mood. 3 or 4 people come over and we start playing beer pong. I dont remember anything afterwards. Next day I wake up and Im still drunk. I go to talk to Maddy and ask if I can lay down in bed with her because the futon is not comfy at all. She says yah, as long as I take my shirt off because there was a bit of vomit on the back of it. I lay down and ask her wtf happened last night. Apparently I got very friendly and drunkenly told her how beautiful I think she is, kissed her, and told her I dont want to date, but want to be fuck buddies. Im mortified and apologize to her. She insists its no big deal. So we lay there and somehow we start talking about sex, porn, and our kinks. Then were cuddling, and she moves my hand to her chest, and I think you guys can guess what happened next. We laid in bed all day fooling around, it was awesome. Thank you drunk me. tl;dr: Drunkenly told my close friend how beautiful I think she is, kissed her and asked to be fucked buddies(dont remember doing this). Now were fwb's.

I was going to preorder, but I figured I already had a well working car and I rarely drive it, so I would rather not spend the resources to build a car I don't necessarily need. I got to thinking about the range being really the only limiting factor to electric cars, especially for appealing to the masses. I thought I would open up a discussion about the possibility of an on-board self sustaining charging unit. I read an article and they were stating this on the model S: ""To cover 15,243 miles, I used 5,074 kWh of electricity, for an average of 333 watt-hours per mile. That's a bit better than the car's EPA-rated efficiency of 350 Wh/mi, and converts to precisely 3 miles per kWh."" With that in mind what kind of a front mounted wind turbine would be needed to maintain that kind of juice and would it even be viable? Or maybe even some kind of rim with spinners on the inside using the motion of the car to generate electricity without taking away power from the car? I just thought it was odd with all this cool tech that there aren't already self charging cars. I guess we are kinda getting into the realm of free energy machines."

It was the first time I met someone off the internet and she nearly broke my faith in the whole system. Her name was Tanya and she was from the northern suburbs of Brisbane. She was into hip hop music and described herself as ""lithe"". Her picture looked a bit old but my loins thought it looked alright. We arranged to meet at my local pub. I rock up and sit down and within about 20 seconds this tubby fat chick in an Eminem branded track suit comes over and sit down. I am just about to say ""excuse me, you fat slag, but this table is reserved"" when I realised that it is Tanya. I can tell from the similarities to the picture she sent me. If I squinted and added 50 pounds and about 10 years. She sits down and says ""fucken how are ya!"" with a mouthful of gum. I sit horrified across from her. I am simply stunned. I want to run but I am frozen to the spot. I decided to 'tough this one out' We order some food. I order a light calamari salad. She orders the lamb shanks and some garlic bread and a cheese pizza. I am not shitting you. I decided at this point to start drinking heavily. So does Tanya, except I think she had about 4 hours on me. She was all over the place. Conversation was mainly about her and how much she loved shooting guns at clay targets. Also feral pigs and how you haven't lived unless you've knifed a pig and felt its blood run over your arms. It is at this point that I start looking for hidden cameras. I am completely sure that I am on some reality TV show. I start smiling faintly at the windows and nearby bushes in the vain hope that a well dressed lady with a microphone will come out and tell me ""Tanya"" is an actress. We'll have a laugh and I'll shake my head and go home feeling silly but relieved. This doesn't happen. Our meals arrive. I daintily pick at the salad, being mindful not to make a pig of myself. Tanya has no such qualms. She's eating like a Viking. Just pure mastication and yammering about guns. She licks her fucking plate clean. Licks it! She then asks me ""are you gonna finish that?"" and points at my half finished salad. ""Knock yourself out, love"" It was like feeding time at the zoo. A zoo where the only animals were a weird hybrid walrus-warthog creature. I was in shock. We finish the meal and I pay. Now it gets awkward. I do the whole charade of ""gee will you look at the time?"". Tanya, swaying slightly, just asks me outright ""so,you wanna take me home and fuck me?"" I was disgusted. There is no way I will take this porker back to my home. I have standards. Standards that need to be kept. So I bent her over some rubbish bins in a nearby alley and shagged her senseless."

Often times these lead to predictions of his demise but it rarely works out that way. After the Paris attacks, Trump's numbers went up. I think this is mostly a byproduct of the fall of Carson, his supporters went mostly to Cruz and and Trump who have both went up in the polls. But then Trump stupidly made a turn to the far-right making a series of statements that have lead to him being labelled a fascist. Democrats, Republicans, the media have all widely labelled him a fascist and not entirely without merit. We don't yet really know the effect of this. Virtually all the polling we have has been conducted before the bulk of this development. There is one Reuters poll not worth discussing for various reasons. The polls coming out in the next week or so will tell us if Trump can survive this, arguably his biggest controversy in the campaign so far. It does not get much worse than literally fascism. I think if he is still #1 in two weeks, he is pretty much unstoppable and will be far more likely to win the nomination"

I was reading the Bible today, and I read Matthew, and 19:28 was a point of interest for me today since it states, ""Jesus said to them, 'Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."" As we know, the unforgivable sin is blasphemy against the Spirt (Matthew 12:32), which Peter was forgiven by Jesus, so I tend to think Judas may have gone to heaven, as he was encouraged by Jesus in John 13:27 to do what he had to do. This was obviously when Judas went to get the soldiers to arrest Jesus. So in a sense, Jesus sanctioned the betrayal and obviously chose Judas at the very start knowing what he would ultimately do to Jesus in the end. In fact, Judas, in a sense was born for the very mission. Either way, as we see in Matthew 23:7, Judas is seized by remorse and throws away the 30 pieces of silver, and he goes and commits suicide by hanging. My question is knowing all of this, Judas was not very much different from Peter - he betrayed Jesus and expressed remorse for his actions. Plus with the verse from Matthew 19:28, is it correct to believe that Judas did enter Paradise? Can anyone shed some light on this?"

So in the NHL you can calculate the average save% of all the goalies that played that year (they are trying to see why scoring is down, and they it is because the goalies are putting up a better save%). Now this league wide save% at the end of the year is say 90.9% this doesn't mean that every goalie put up a 90.9 save% in every game because we can have different save% from game to game and goalie to goalie.

She wasn't home enough to enforce the rules. I wish I could say this was unique, but when you are in the inner city it becomes norm. We were honestly lucky the mom took time off of work to meet with us. I told the mom to take the XBox, bike, etc and, instead of hiding it, take it, with the child, to the pawn shop. Sell it and go buy herself some clothes or something nice. Funny thing is, I don't think she had the will to do it. She was honestly scared of her child.

Another way of explaining it is that we're creating a benchmark good (international or ppp dollars, but just as easily gold or bricks or dildoes) and comparing everything else to that. The Economist prefers big macs for this purpose, as it ends up being a little easier to grasp. Exchange rates don't actually follow PPP theory for a variety of reasons, so it is mostly used to construct alternate exchange rates that take into account different costs of living for comparison purposes. EG: an straight currency conversion puts Indian per capita GDP at $1k, while a PPP$ comparison puts it at ~$4k."

The pixel clock could be considered the ""CPU"" of the display, at least in terms of how fast it can refresh the information on the screen. You want more MHz and more GHz for your CPU so you can run programs more quickly, right? Well, by manually turning the pixel clock higher, ""overclocking"" beyond the supplied configuration, you're able to achieve a more frequent screen refresh. The result is an overclock of the refresh rate from 60 to any value above 60, until the hardware is unable to sustain the overclock without visible artifacts (individual pixels may exhibit flashing, blinking, ""snow"", etc.) This is why we are able to purchase 75, 120, even 144 Hz monitors.

But people who carry a gun for self defense think that it's a less shitty last resort than the alternative - being unarmed when facing someone with the means and intent to kill you. The statistics don't lie. If you have a gun in your house, it is statistically more likely to kill someone it shouldn't than to protect you. But the risks to innocent people can be mitigated by responsible gun ownership and proper training. A gun never killed anyone it wasn't pointed at. People are more likely to die in a car accident if they own a car, they're more likely to have kids drown in their pool if they own a pool. I'm not picking these examples out of a hat, cars and pools are far more dangerous to innocent people than guns are. Car and pool owners think they can manage these risks, they make their kids buckle up, they put a gate around the pool. They feel the benefits outweigh the risks. They have influence over the risk that they're going to kill someone. So do gun owners. You don't like it, you don't think people should have the right to carry a gun. The courts disagree, they've interpreted the constitution to mean that individuals have a right to bear arms. Some people choose to exercise that right."

This person needs professional help. I understand why people are mocking him, that it was an incredibly bad decision, that it's entirely ridiculous that they justified what they did and how they did it... But this is what one form of addiction is and looks like. This is a desperation to do something either to fix a problem, to regulate negative emotions, to remove oneself from one's experiences. That's why they chose ketamine, a dissociative; they are trying to check out. If you ever run into a situation like this with someone close to you in your life, take it extremely seriously, encourage that they seek out help. Be supportive, to a point that is maintainable, be ready to catch them a few times, be ready to let them fall... be ready to walk away if you need to. Get them help from a psychologist as well as a psychiatrist, I cannot stress enough how important it is to have both working with you in a case like this. Laugh it up a bit as far as the situation goes, but keep in mind that behind it all is someone who is most likely suffering."

Certainly it *helps* in regard that the person gets to that person out of bed and so on, but in the long run it'll turn out to be a dependency and disservice. It's difficult to make comparisons to these things, but putting myself as an example here; I had (and to a lesser degree still have) trouble with anxiety attacks and acute hyperventilation. One of these symptoms are that I feel a sudden shortness of breath and need to breathe in oxygen, which in turn causes hyperventilation. A mechanism I 'acquired' was that it helped to yawn when I felt this sensation. Just forcing myself to yawn and then do that for several minute's worth. Problem is though that this became a crutch and it became such a dependency that I went around my entire day just yawning which gave all sorts of impressions on my colleagues and friends. My doctor, when learning this, urged me to try to get rid of this habit ASAP as it'd only become more and more difficult to stop doing the longer you integrate it into your ordinary day.

And really not the NRA but the millions of members who fund the NRA and vote damned near single issue to protect our 2nd Amendment rights. Because without the NRA I think Sandy Hook would have done us in, Democrats had speeches prepared just waiting for a platform of young child corpses to deliver them from, they know an opportunity for a power grab when they see one. Waiting in the wings we have rich liberals like Blooomberg are always looking for ways to reduce America's freedom.

If two people are from the same country and meet each other, that brings it down from 7 billion to a few hundred million. And the fact that they are romantically interested in each other increases the chances that they are a) from similar social class b) within the same generation c) live in the same geographic area. When you are little or a young person, the time that you vacation and travel is seasonal and coincides with school. The amount of travel destinations is relatively small; a small handful of destinations in a small handful of countries and cities. When you are on vacation you take *hundreds* of pictures, when it's a spot like the Eiffel tower, it's a big lawn where hundreds of tourists are taking pictures. So the situation is as follows: I married one of the thousands of people who grew up within 100 miles of me, and happened to be vacationing in the same highly popular tourist destination during the small window of time most people have to be vacationing. Also our families could afford to vacation abroad in the first place, which increases our chances of being downselected to one of a very small number of universities. One of us happened to be in the field of view of one of the cameras during the thousands of pictures we, or our parents, or our siblings took during one of our many vacations to a small selection of locations."

How is 15% of $1000 more of a loss than 15% of $20000? If you're talking about a fine or sales tax than yes that becomes more of a loss bc it is attached to a cost other than income so there is more buying power being eaten up.

An *even larger* number of businesses &amp; people (advertising &amp; PR firms, and of course the graphic artists &amp; other staff people they employ) earn a significant PART of their living. -- Those people all now have a vested interest in keeping this stuff going -- to admit that it was false... Well, to admit it and DO SOMETHING about that (like quit or refuse to create/promote the material that one is ""tasked"" with, or even attempt to introduce some honesty or objectivity or even any caveats or ""doubt"")... well that would mean *not* being able to repay the student loans, or to pay the rent &amp; utilities, and of course in many cases to risk the house, the car, the health insurance, any ""presents"" for the kid(s), etc. Even far short of that -- even to admit *internally* and to themselves that it's ""not entirely true"" -- is to begin to *dislike* their job (and not just over trivial matters), and even, presuming there is some ""conscience"" present in each individual, to eventually begin to *hate themselves* for being complicit in such a large hoax, or fraud upon the public. -- So what do people do? Well, they engage in ""thought stopping"", that is they ""won't go there"", not even for a moment in their mind (or at least not if they can help it) will they contemplate any doubts -- in fact in order to avoid thinking those potentially ""heretical"" things, they will become *more* strident, recommit themselves to their core dogmatic belief(s). Which of course then provides more than sufficient fuel to go into work the following week and produce things like... well like the linked graphic. -- Thus the end result is much like the world of Orwell's *1984* the GOAL of a lot of this propaganda... ***isn't*** really to try to convince the ""proles"" (they're too busy being kept entertained &amp; occupied by the ""prolefeed"", i.e. what are the Kardashians up to, etc) -- rather its to try to keep the ""party members"" -- i.e. everyone ELSE in the government &amp; NGO ""industry"" (or the ""faith"" if you will) both thinking ""correct"" thoughts as well as to keep them ""keyed up"" to continue their own little complicit parts in maintaining the wider ""establishment""."

The vote fails, and within 2 minutes I'm removed from the group. Keep in mind none of these people were from the same server.

ISIS actively recruits people from all over the world with intent to train these people and move them back into their host countries as sleepers with the intent to commit mass terror attacks against civilians. They're also actively capturing and killing aid workers and journalists, and if left unchecked would continue towards a genocidal goal of killing off all Kurds, Jewish, and non-agreeing muslims. This is a VERY different situation than before. War sucks. We just finally got out of 2 very long wars, and now we're going to get drawn into a new one. Unfortunately this isn't something we can ignore ala 1930's Nazi Germany. If ISIS continues to spread, and continues to grow in power, it will directly affect not only the Middle East, but Europe and the US as well.

We didn't win. I've been waiting for concrete information to surface regarding pricing of the winning bids at the auction last week. Everyone's been very close-mouthed about it, and I don't think that's healthy. This is a public auction by a U.S. government agency where pricing is of substantial general interest. So, here goes. I was a participant in a syndicate in the auction. Our composite bid whose bid was slightly more than 10% below spot and the syndicate didn't win. (And no, I won't name the syndicate, so please don't ask.) The importance of this in my mind is that the winning bidders must have bid very close to market or above to win. Nobody got a bargain.

Devalue the player's choice so that the divergent storylines end up in the same place.

I won't say specifically what I was working on, but we were testing out some interesting things in anticipation for use in 2016. Suffice to say classic neighborhood canvassing is out in favor of a fully targeted mobile system that has more information than you could imagine about individuals and neighborhoods as a whole. There will be multiple teams of social media ""gurus"" staffing an office 24/7 scouring the internet for anything relevant (positive, or negative), and then pass along the interesting stuff to ""friends"" (read:well disguised bot army, or shill groups if the bots aren't good enough) that will share content on every social media site. Oh, and promoted content galore - yet it will be fairly inconspicuous. No, the super annoying tv attack ads aren't going away just yet. But remember - they aren't designed for you. Their only purpose is to rile up the low-infos and 65+ retirees. So they'll still be scaring grandma and grandpa like old-times. What's really going to interesting to see is if their ideas for reaching the millennial and younger crowd actually work, and not get tuned out like in years past. It'll probably end up being another lame attempt at rock the vote - which haven't really worked as of yet, obviously. final note - There's definitely a need to manage a candidate's appearances a little better. Jets are a pre-requisite for POTUS campaigning - however, they were misused last time out. Re-fuel stops in various towns were packaged as a ""pep rally"" but were nothing more than boring 45 minute speeches from local pols followed by a 5 minute canned speech from the candidate that everyone there had heard before. Anyway, I've typed far more than I had intended - apologies! Oh - **disclaimer** I'm not pretending to have super secret intel straight from the DNC/RNC.

Immigration is one of the major issues in our country where we see many lines blurred. Most people perceive Republicans as heavily anti-immigrant, however that is not always true. Farm owners, and the agricultural industry as a whole, often circumvent the law, and lure migrant Mexican workers into the US with promise of better pay then they make in Mexico. This happens in red states and blue states, by republicans and democrats. This has complicated the legislation process, and is a reason why we haven't seen comprehensive immigration reform in decades. We saw Reagan and Bush use executive actions to grant amnesty to undocumented immigrants, and we're seeing it again because we don't have representatives in congress that are willing to lead, and craft comprehensive immigration reform. President Obama's executive action on immigration is not controversial, and is a step in the right direction for fixing our broken immigration system. It's cliche to say broken immigration system, but the system is extremely broken, and does not look to be fixed wholly anytime soon. I don't understand why people are so upset that the President wants to crack down on border crossers, and broaden the tax base by granting temporary citizenship. The action also starts to prioritize deportations by going after those who pose a threat to our society, opposed to just willy-nilly going after everyone without rhyme or reason. Truth is, we don't have the resources for that, and it's not Obama's fault. The system is broken, and needs to be fixed. This is a step in the right direction. Let's be thankful someone in Washington wants to set the foundation for reform. Immigration is an extremely complicated issue, and it seems most people are upset because they either don't understand the immigration problem, or don't trust the president."

From what we've seen of the leaks, and proposals made by the FBI, the US government would like to break into any possible ""threats"" well in advance regardless of the risk to the average user and the security of the internet as a whole - or more likely specifically to cause such degradation. If anything we can only expect this sort of occurrence to increase in frequency and damage done as they continue their campaign. Until we find a way to bring these asshats in check, literally everyone and everything with internet access is at risk for collateral damage. What I find especially funny is that while they regularly hack others and spread malware, we've got proposals to charge the average person even talking about hacking or other similar topics under RICO for **organized crime**. NSA is already doing far worse than talking about it on a global level, and it seems there's no real accountability for it."

OWS fell into obscurity after its initial boom not because it was prevented from growing, but because it didn't have a *cohesive* message... it lacked a strong ideal in favour of the ""everyone's opinion matters and should be given equal airtime"" approach.... if it had a core message, it was most certainly ""income disparity exists, and is bad, mkay?""... but not everyone agreed on that (some people felt that was ""too socialist"" a message), and there was never any plausible solution to rally behind... I'd say that any movement that serves to identify a problem without proposing any decent solutions is doomed to fail... particularly once it's been infiltrated with people that don't really care about the problem at the core of the movement, and have ""solutions"" that would only serve to make the problem worse. Now, it seems to me that Basic Income was the solution OWS didn't have a grasp on at the time. The BI education movement started after the OWS movement had lost steam.... and now we're two separate (but often overlapping) groups with the same goal. The difference between us is that the BI movement has a *really good plan* while OWS still to this day has a *lot* of supporters that we haven't managed to tap into yet. So, I propose a question: What will in take to re-invigorate Occupy with Basic Income as its core mantra?"

At the top of the IRS food chain they had to send paper work for my parents to fill out. After completing it, they turned it in. My parents called and there was another problem. The fee was growing every single day. The IRS transfered them to a different department (or some bullshit). My parents played it safe and paid the fee because it was going to grow to a point where it would become a real financial hit and they had no faith that the IRS would resolve it. TLDR: my parents went through the IRS to resolve a mistaken fee. The mistake was on the IRS's side. After hours of phone calls and paper work the fee didn't get resolved and my parents paid it.

Ricky has alot of trophies for playing and it makes him feel good to get one"" He then explained to her they weren't getting trophies and unless they win the remaining 3 games, they'd have 0 chance of even getting into the final tournament.

There are two ways you can change the behaviour of video game journalists: 1. Boycott video games. Stop paying money for games that you feel aren't being marketed honestly. If enough people do this you will change how video games are marketed. Realistically, you might come to realize that GG is nowhere close to big enough or committed enough to impact anything but comment sections. 2. Compete with unethical journalists. Became video game journalists yourselves and provide an ethical alternative. Succeeding at this would prove that ethical video game journalism is a viable business and force the current landscape to change. Realistically, you might come to realize that your idea of ""ethics"" is childish and naive because the business world cares about what makes money, not what makes forum posters happy.

If sex is that important for red-pillers, why don't they move to Europe and partake in escorts? Its pratically legal in every Euro Country even if it the Country itself is not as blatant about it as Germany is, lol. Anyway, red pillers are mostly kids.

A lot of companies are responding to unfavorable labor laws by minimizing their employees. My dad's an engineer, a good one. The company he works for is going under however and he's looking for a new job. But traditional engineering firms are disappearing. Most of the old ones have switched to a system where they don't hire you as an employee. They create an arrangement where you exclusively work for them as a freelancer. They got zero responsibilities towards you, you don't have any rights or expectations from them. Any hour you're not on assignment, is an hour you don't get paid. And they don't like you sticking around too long to avoid having it look like a disguised employer/employee relationship. In that climate it makes no sense to use your company's name as your personal identifier because you'll probably go through several a year. It's only useful as a corporate identifier while you work for them. It would be useless for say your passport, your tax returns or your family history. I predict that the entire concept of an employee or lasting individual-corporation relationship will no longer exist in a 100 years. As an individual you'd be better of naming yourself after your trade than your clients... hey that sounds familiar don't it?"

You'd be wrong but let's say it. We can clear the drains before a storm, but with winds like these they quickly block up with leaves and small branches. During the brunt I have to clear the drain every 30-60 minutes to keep it flowing, and I know exactly where the drain is and it's only 1-2 feet underwater. City teams probably can't be that quick or efficient which makes the problems worse. Also there is sometimes a limit to how much water can actually exit the system.

I'd have to check again, but it's well over 20. He took Observant. So, what that means.... I give him everything. Period. I pass notes to him constantly, he is both empowered by and absolutely crippled by this ability. Every scene, every room... I'll describe what's up and then either verbally or through a note describe what he notices on top of it. So, practically that means when in the shop, everyone sees the clerk and his goods and those swords there and the counter and the cash box and all that. The Rogue sees all that and has a note about roughly how much is probably in that box from the sound of it, across the room; the type of lock on that cabinet, that the shop keep has a dagger under his vest on the left side; that the place smells faintly of rotting apples probably from some garbage or something upstairs that makes him a little nauseated. When in the dungeon? Over there? Trap. On that square there. Two people, at least, talking behind that door over there. The hobgoblin coming at him is taller than the rest and has a rank insignia different than the other four. He gets to know who is more or less hurt looking around him. He gets to smell Orcs on the wind. He gets to hear flapping in the distance and the sound of something metallic clinking in the dark... ...all when nobody else does. Now, often as not, I hit him with things that aren't necessarily plot or danger relevant. Just because he gets a note--as far as the players are concerned--doesn't mean it matters. I keep giving him stuff to couch the REAL stuff away from meta-game expectations of notes = danger. And he plays it well. When he notices some guy pissing in a far corner of the warehouse they're meeting a gang leader in, he just doesn't mention it to anyone. He doesn't talk about all the times he smells the different levels of BO or freshness in the party. Doesn't talk about all the different flowers around the campsite he's noticed or how many bats seems to be flying at night while they walk through the woods or that the temperature in THIS room in the dungeon is a little colder than the last room but also a little quieter. So, it makes it more powerful when he's able to--because people have tuned out the ""note passing""--surprise people by calmly saying while walking through town... ""We're being followed, started a few blocks back--there are six of them, one's on the roof over my left shoulder and the other five are those kids that keep playing with the sticks loudly. They're not kids, though, halflings... good actors, not good enough. Don't know why, but they keep eyeballing us and following and at least one of them--the one with the brown hat--he's got a crossbow in that sack."" And everyone is like ""oh... shit... "" Anyhow. Play with it. It doesn't break the game. In our last combat I drew out the scene on the battle mat and made an ""accidental"" few marks while doing it. Real subtle, nothing more than a little line. Then I ""tried erasing them"" and they smudged a bit. Nobody thought of it. When the battle started, I sent my Rogue a note ""smudges are the edges of some kind of trap--you see the work, but don't know WHAT it is--remember THEY can't see smudges"". So he was shouting as people were running into the room: ""No.... no, don't go over to THAT wall. Stay away from that ledge there!"" because he saw what others didn't. It was cool. Monk ran right through a trap because Rogue couldn't articulate EXACTLY where things were in the heat of battle."

So you cannot study a specific GM corn and then affirm have a headline saying ""Study found (no) health effects from GMOs"" People are worried with different things, some are worried with health, some with butterflies and honey bees and long term sustainability. And putting a blanket statement over GMOs being bad or good is just a way to misinformation. I want the label, though. I think it will further the discussion into more detail. I want more testing.

They still kept trying to talk me out of it. I pointed out to them that by that time, my house was already built and due to easement rules, the only place I could build an attached garage would have the garage door facing the street and THAT was specifically NOT allowed in the rules.

More cupholders Items 1 &amp; 2 for anyone paying attention seem to be coming very soon, with new cars coming with sensors/hardware to support at least some if not all of these things. Item #3 is absurd. It's one of the things I really like about the car. Just be responsible for your own actions. Item #4, just doesn't seem to be that big of a deal. A lot of functionality can be controlled from the steering wheel. I'd much rather they expanded the voice commands to include things like climate control and the sunroof than to add more physical buttons. Item #5, author seems to be unaware of the angled shelf below touch screen. There is a center console that seems to be shipping out very slowly. So far I haven't found the storage situation that big of a problem, despite being concerned about it when I got the car. Item #6, they sell cupholders for the backseat, though I agree they are a bit of a joke. The center console also adds more cupholders in the front.

Also keep in mind if you want to have +3 plate and a bard buffing you, the druid probably also has a ridiculous magic item and a bard buffing him. You definitely need a weapon that is considered magic, as earth elemental resists more or less most damage types (including bludgeoning piercing and slashing) Let's not even give the druid a bard or magic items. Druid starts the day casting foresight, giving it advantage on all its rolls, and all attacks disadvantage against it. Walks around as an earth elemental because fuck it why not. Gets into combat. Did you do at least 126+ 243HP (5per hit die+5con mod +tough) in the first round with disadvantage on all your attacks? If so congrats you won, if not he puts another layer of 126 as a bonus action and casts contagion on you, he has advantage on the spell attack roll. Did you get hit? If so get stunned whenever you take damage for the next 3 rounds no save, and this lasts for 7 days if you can't succeed on 3 con saves that you have disadvantage on. For the rest of the fight, he just casts stupidly powerful spells, or just uses the earth elementals multi attack at a +8 for (2d8+5) twice, with advantage.

Just because *some* conspiratards say to not trust the news, and *some* conspiratards wonder why certain things aren't covered, it doesn't necessarily follow that the *same* people are holding these apparently contrary views. I'm *not* saying that there aren't people out there expressing this cognitive dissonance. Hell, I'm quite sure there are, and that they'd have a good convoluted explanation for why it's a completely rational position.

I remember some leftist movements actually calling for worsening the situation of the workers in industrialized nations just to get them off their asses to fight and die in the revolution they think is the necessary outcome of history. It's when you have this almost religious view of the world and your ideology when you forget that the end goal of your perfect society is a world in which all people have better lives, not a world in which your personal phantasies are fulfilled. It's a mindset straight from the 19th century, I think, when death and violence were much more prevalent and accepted in humanity.

I've also added cooked quinoa at times. This time, I added 2 cups of cooked elbow macaroni. I just use whatever I have on hand. Then, I take quart size freezer bags and put about 2 cups or so worth in them, and freeze them. I flatten the bag before I seal it and put it in the freezer to thin out the supply, that way, when I'm ready to feed them, I just break off a chunk and either let it thaw, or microwave it for 30 seconds to take the freeze off.

After the 2010 elections his ability to push for or enact any form of financially costly legislation was pretty much destroyed because the GOP refused to vote for anything that wasn't already ""paid for"". Meanwhile, they were simultaneously pushing for *tax breaks*, making it even harder to get existing things ""paid for"" since at that point the left was struggling just to keep the lights on. How could anyone push for infrastructure projects or new spending when half the government was voting to *shut itself down*?"

To these companies, their worth is determined by profits. The problem is, this goes the other way too. Look at who funds the 'settled science' and look at the way they won't release their data - or worse, when they do (or it's hacked out of them), we find out there is just blatant lying and algorithms that won't create anything other than a hockey stick and temp sensors that violate published standards (sitting outside banks of apartment A/C units, smack dab in the middle of a black top parking lot) and on and on. To these groups, their worth is determined by being published and getting prestigious positions withing these groups. I believe in 'climate change' because we have thermometers and we can see the effects as shown in this article. Alaska's fresh water is just drying up. Then look at the more recent ice-bore data. There are huge swings in temperature, over very short time periods. There is nothing we could do to either cause or prevent those effects. We find the remains of tropical trees in Antarctica. Also, I have not had any adequately debunk the idea that if you look at Inconvenient Truth data, the warming precedes the CO2 rise. Which makes sense when you look at things like how much Methane is released from the permafrost once it's exposed by warming. Before you just downvote me for being stupid, or uninformed, or whatever pejorative term you attack religious people for using on Atheists who 'don't believe', how about you avoid what amounts to telling me to just have 'faith'. In the end I hope hope HOPE that it was man that has caused these climate changes, because it means we MIGHT be able to reverse it. But there is too much bullshit on either side of these debate to NOT be skeptical. I believe in evolution, I believe the earth is 4+ Billion years old, I don't think man walked with the dinosaurs, I think we went to the moon, and I would go to a doctor if I was sick. BUT anyone saying 'the science is settled' is just not a scientist. Science is NEVER settled - it just has the 'best estimate with current information'. The irony is (as an atheist) when I discuss this I hear all the same rhetoric I get when I discuss religion with very religious people."

He doesn't like Zimmerman's friend Joe Oliver, who came out today and put facts to certain assumptions that are being made. Fact 1: Zimmerman is a Latino, who Oliver calls multi-cultural. So Ed has called into question his credibility, even suggesting that Oliver, an African American, is ""Racist"". Fact 2: Zimmerman was injured the night of the incident.

The best part of the sale is I get to say no. No we will not box, wrap, bag, that heavily discounted item. No you can't speak to the manager. No you can't get another discount. No no no no no no no. Tis glorious to say no. This year was shaping up to be a doozy with the ladies (and occasional hapless husband looking confused and frightened) clawing at the gates and looking at their watches and sighing loudly. We opened the gates and in they tore, the guy opening the gates nimbly hopped on a cart to avoid being trampled. Their hands were in claws as they shoved for carts and baskets. One of my cashiers could not get to safety fast enough. She's eight months pregnant. Her eyes widened with fear as the snarling beast rushed towards her. The lead animal pushed her aside screaming ""MOVE!!!"" The cashier fell into the display racks she was standing next to as the swarm continued passed. Luckily she was not hurt, just mad and scared that her baby could have been seriously hurt. Me? Well I was fuming. These are GROWN women acting like toddlers and hell, that is not right. Fortunately for me, the woman who pushed the cashier rolled her junk right through my line. I debating ways to get back at her for shoving as she handed over cash to pay. She gave me a fifty which I ran through my counterfeit machine. Our machine has a small sensor that squeaks when the magnetic ink is rubbed over it and a small red light that turns on. But she didn't know that. So I had an evil idea. I told her the bill was not passing my counterfeit machine and that I could not accept it. She was furious to say the least, with visible steam pouring from her snout. Especially since she had to run down the block to an ATM to get out twenties. But hey, if you wanted me to make your life easy maybe you shouldn't have shoved a pregnant girl."

The second he said that the U.S. has the largest expenditure of GDP on domestic healthcare is because anyone can get it just isn't true. He's missing out on some key points, one of which being that our emergency room system is being incredibly misused. That in and of itself ends up expensive to the government because of the way emergency care is federally handled. He simultaneously says that anyone can get free care and poor people can free care. He doesn't really do anything to make a case here; of course people of a certain income have different kinds of access to care, but it is not the same care, and it's hardly as equal as he tries to imply when we have an insanely high level of medical indigency. Not anyone who is just poor or doesn't pay their bills because they say they are poor get free care. He oversimplified and misconstrued reality there. I like how he doesn't factor in that another reason U.S. GDP expenditure on medical care is so high is because the U.S. government subsidizes high end insurance coverage. It's a regressive system. He does make an ok point about the ACA. It isn't as good a piece of legislation that it could have been. It has some decent things in there, and it is expected to do some overall economic good as per the Congressional Budget Office research. But it is pretty far from anything that could at all be considered universal in the sense of Canada or the U.K., which is what a lot of people think. Calling it Obamacare is also silly since the eventual legislation that was passed hardly resembled what it was initially supposed to be. I haven't taken a look at his other comments because I'm on my way out the door, but I can later and edit in the other criticisms I'll probably have."

There was a woman who would bring her extremely autistic son in. She had him on one of those child-harness things (i.e. a leash), but she never bothered to actually hold on to the harness, so he would wander freely through the store while she browsed. When she decided it was time to go, she would want through the store yelling his name at the top of her voice. Seriously, let me paint the picture for you: I would be standing there, casually folding shirts like a good little worker bee, absorbed in what I was doing (gotta fold those shirts nice and perfect, don't want any wrinkles, no sir). Suddenly, without warning, from DIRECTLY behind me, would be a shout of: ""PAULIE!! PAAAAUUUULIIIIEEE!!"" Mini heart attack, I swear. Have you ever seen the movie Babe, when Magda Szubanski's character would call out, ""Heeeeerrreee, pig pig pig!""? Something like that. She would keep this up, wandering the store screaming his name until she found him. Here's the clincher: This kid had been found by various people - staff and general public - in extremely odd and/or dangerous places. One time, he had wandered off to the bank down the street. One time, we found in our service lift trying to climb a trolley full of boxes that had been left in there. One time, a customer dragged him to our front desk, in tears because he had just pulled Paulie off the busy main street outside the store (it's a major road through a largish country town, and it's the only road to the city so it gets a lot of traffic). No matter how many people yelled at her, no matter how many times security/police/child services were called, she always came back and she always did the same thing. The thought if her voice still sends shivers down my spine. tl;dr: If you have it on leash, don't forget to hold the other end!"

I've been both a player and a GM in various systems for the last fourteen years or so. Right now, I'm playing in a game of Pathfinder with five other PCs - all of whom are completely green - and a GM of unknown experience. Generally, things are okay, but my main issue is this: the sessions last entirely too long. The average time for a session is about six hours. It makes it impossible to pick a time to play, since we're blowing almost an entire day, and we're all exhausted by the end. When I was at my most active, my friends and I always had a rule about session length: no longer than four hours. Granted, we were all in college at the time, so it behooved us to keep strict time limits. As a GM, my sessions usually last between three and four hours. It's by no means brief, but you can make an afternoon/evening of it without going nuts. It doesn't help that my fellow adventurers can't go more than twenty minutes without taking a bong rip or passing around a joint. I don't really give a crap about sobriety in a session, but they're all so new that they can't keep the rules straight, and it makes the pace of the sessions *glacial*. In a six-hour session, we do maybe three hours of content. The kicker is that the pace is boring them all as well, even though they're half the problem. There's other issues with the campaign as well, but the fact that I have to sacrifice the majority of my day to accomplishing what I know I could get my players through in half an afternoon is driving me nuts. Am I just being oversensitive, or are the sessions just too damn long?"

A lot of traditions aren't relevant to us - there is no bride, so there is no dress (obviously), no dad walking anyone down the aisle, no spending the night before apart. We are a binational couple - my fiance is from the US - and it seems that there is a lot more tradition in US weddings, most of which we are steering away from on the basis that it is a civil ceremony and neither of us are religious. We are having groomsmaids (can't stop calling them bridesmaids), plus ushers, and no best men - as cheesy as it sounds, we are each others' best man. It's refreshing to be able to choose what we want without fear of being judged; I was a bridesman for a friend a few years back, and they got some comments about how strange it was not to have bridesmaids. We won't have that problem as no-one goes in with preconceptions - in fact it will be the first same-sex marriage that most of our guests will have been to. First for us, too!

For starters, I'm part of that rare group of humans with what I'm coming to understand is an abnormally large penis. I'm big and tall and I've always known I was bigger then average. But now I'm kinda starting to feel like a bit of a freak. When hard I'm 9.5 inches long, and I don't know how big around, but to big to close my hand all the way around. Add to that, for personal reasons I won't go into here, I got a Prince Albert piercing. My last girl friend cheated on me with another dude, ruining my already poor self esteem. I now know she did it for the attention not the sex, but I can't help but think it's because she didn't like my dick. It doesn't help that she was always sore after sex though. To be clear, I'm an attentive partner. I enjoy going down on girls, and will generally get a girl off at least once before sex, because otherwise I don't really fit to easily. Now to the problem, my new gf is not that experienced and is pretty much just afraid of me. She's a great girl otherwise, but it's killing my self confidence even more. I take out the piercing when we are going to mess around because I know it just makes me look more intimidating. But it's as much just the size that scares her as anything else. The problem is that I know she's afraid I'll hurt her, and so I try to be extra careful and go extra slow. But then I can't stay hard enough to actually do anything. It's a vicious downward spiral. Between my past issues, scaring her, and not being able to stay hard for fear of hurting her, my self confidence is plummeting. And that makes it even more difficult to stay hard. It's to the point I'm thinking about giving up on sex because it just makes me feel worse. **TL;RD** My girlfriend is afraid of my big penis and it's killing my self esteem. What should I do."

951823,0,"end day, taxpayer paying double.",mindlessrabble,politics,0,0,0,2013-12,2013-12-13 15:08:09,"The ""study"" is flawed. Technically they are paying the ""contractors"" more than equivalent government employees in some cases. However, 9 times out of 10, the people actually doing the work are either ""sub-contractors"" or they are salaried or hourly employees of the contractor in question. There are other things involved as well that aren't mentioned. Many of the jobs the Federal government contracts out involve positions that require security clearances. Depending on the terms / location of the contract, many times the company who took the contract is required to pay for background checks on their actual employees. Add that to the cost. Please note I said ""many times"" - again it depends on the contract who picks up the tab. Also keep in mind that some things were contracted out simply because the government could not consistently fill certain jobs in certain locations with qualified personnel. That's where a contractor comes in. Regardless of all that, the article linked tries to simplify a very complicated situation. Not all contracts or jobs are created equal, and anyone with any common sense knows this. A simple example would be replacing a job done my say enlisted military personnel with civilian contractors. This is probably one of the most prevalent situations that you'd run across. According to this study you would just compare how much the military personnel actually doing the job made versus how much the contractors now actually doing the job make. That comparison would be flawed from the get go. If you have military personnel doing a certain job, you have to have a military infrastructure in place to support those personnel. Take the example of an infantry soldier deployed to say Afghanistan. Just to put that one solider in the field it takes 10-12 personnel to support that soldier. Many times government positions are replaced with contractors out of necessity. It's very common for military personnel to do a certain job in a certain location for a long time period. When that person retires or leaves the military, many times it's much easier to simply hire that person - now a civilian - to keep doing the same job. Much easier than training someone else to do the job that person is already qualified to do. If they REALLY wanted to look at waste in the Government on EVERY level (Fed, State, County, City) they would need to take a long, HARD look at construction and common maintenance contracts. It's COMMON for general construction contractors to charge the government a significantly higher price than they would charge a civilian customer for the SAME job. Same goes for general maintenance contracts. Some of this was caused by dated legislation and regulation that tried to keep the ""old boy"" network from profiting. It backfired in many cases. Many government agencies aren't allowed to shop their contract on the open market - where competition would give them the best deal. They are required to offer their contracts to ""favored"" companies that have been ""Vetted"" by the government. Want to get preference on many government contracts? Hire a few disabled vets or a few employees who are considered ""minorities"". Many times, by law, these companies employing these people get preference regardless of track record or offered price vs service. While the ""intent"" of these laws and regulations were good - the actual result - not so much. All these leaves the taxpayers (that's us) holding the bag - in reality the bill. I've personally seen civilian run and owned contractors take a job, then do the job - but not to the agreed upon specs. The contractor gets paid - then paid again to come in and fix the job they didn't do correctly in the first place. IF these people posting these studies really wanted to shed light on areas that could make the government more efficient AND cost-effective they'd look at certain civilian and government agencies that makes millions (if not more) simply being a ""go-between"" for contracts. One of these agencies is a three letter organization that made a recent, brief appearance in the news for their expensive and over the top ""conference"" in Las Vegas."

Your theory about coping mechanisms isnt that far off, I can identify with that a lot. Do you know anything about breaking those habits? I used to go to a therapist way back, but she only put me on antidepressants and sort of cured the symptoms but not the actual problem. She introduced me to CBT but I never really understood the purpose of it... maybe I wasnt receptive towards it or I started doing it the wrong way. I think one of my main issues is that deep down I have forgotten what taking care of myself is or that I am doing it completly wrong. I have looked around this subreddit and found that exercise is something that have helped others and its something I am going to start doing asap."

I'm sure you've heard how the government does everything for ""safety and security,"" but we know that this is often pretext. By way of illustration, I am familiar with a case where a smaller, less diverse city adjacent to a larger city with an 80% African-American population did not like when African-American's came to their town and used their parks. Since the smaller city could not legally enact a law or post a sign that read ""Whites Only"" they enacted an ordinance which provided that anyone present in the park had to show a valid, government-issued identification bearing an address within the city limits of the local town. When the police from the small town observed African-American's in the park, they promptly requested identification pursuant to their ""legal"" ordinance, and when they saw that the visitors were from the adjacent larger city, they promptly sent them packing. This went on for years until finally someone spent the time, money, and effort to appeal the issue to the state's Court of Appeals, which overruled the ordinance as unconstitutional. Why am I sharing this anecdote? Because the smaller city never published anything that could be ""cited"" explaining that the purpose of the ordinance was to keep African-Americans out of their town nor would they ever do so. This is how government works. When it can't do something directly it is done indirectly and given a facially plausible reason. Your local municipal attorney is never going to publish much less admit to having a ""shoot to kill"" policy as a jury would find this revelation extremely disturbing and punish the municipality with a tremendous damages award, which is the very same effect they are trying to prevent in the first instance. So yes, it is a ""conspiracy"" of sorts in the strictest sense of the word."

Infact based on their readings, they believe that more than half of the continental crust was formed by 3.5 billion years ago. This continuing process reduced the amount of carbon dioxide to the extent that earth became too cold and a massive ice age occurred.

For instance, let's suppose that cities are the places in which the vast majority of pollution from fossil fuels comes from. In other words, where there are more men, there is more pollution. Now take a look at the Earth from orbit at night. Everywhere you see clusters of light (which are more often than not powered by coal burning), you can infer that those areas are far more polluted than the majority of Earth lacking those pollution inducing lights/infrastructure/industrialization/etc. Next overlay a map of the Earth with the life expectancy by nation. Oddly enough, it seems that those areas that are the most polluted, and contributing the most to global warming, are also the leaders in life expectancy. More over, they tend to be the areas that have advanced technology to the point where we can also save lives with greater ease, deliver life with greater ease, and all around are more prosperous per capita. According to those who are proponents against fossil fuels, you would expect to see death, disease, disfigurement, and all around short, miserable lives. In contrary, we are seeing the opposite. If we agree that those things that support life as being good, and that which destroys it as bad, then can we not agree that fossil fuels are part of the good?"

I fired all the staff, sold all the assets, and paid myself a management fee of $10,000 for doing such a good job. Then I directed the company into bankruptcy. None of those students got refunds. They couldn't sue, because the corporation no longer existed. I got rich. The owners of the company got rich. The students got screwed. This is what we mean when we say, ""You didn't build this.""

The *most* surprising thing is something others have already touched on: people don't walk places. I made a friend in LA who absolutely would not accept ""I'll just walk back to the hotel, it's only 45 minutes away"" from me. People seemed confused that I'd walk to the supermarket and back carrying a few bags, as if that would break my back. So I'll say the second-most surprising thing: the variety of different accents and subcultures. Where I'm from, there really aren't that many accents. I was always interested in meeting new people and asking them where their unique accent was from. New York, Maine, Texas, Georgia, Minnesota, Arizona, everywhere sounds so different, and a lot of them are really cool. I didn't attend an American school, but I was always surprised to hear about them. I envied the lack of school uniforms and was intrigued by the elaborate 'school life' there -- football teams, dance teams, cheerleading, rallies, tournaments, there's a ton of stuff that surrounds school in America. Where I went to school, in Australia, we didn't have any of that (or even 'middle schools', which I'm still not clear on). School was just a few hours of lessons each day and a lunchbreak. I always wanted to spend one year straight in America so I could check out one of the schools, but never did. My favourite thing about America was that so many people seemed impressed by my accent.

The extent to which individuals want this is not really relevant -- it's something that we, as a society, want. With email, though, that may have changed -- it may be that we no longer actually need to hold the postal service holy, because people *can* communicate, and not just for the same price as one another, but essentially for free. It would be nice if we rounded out our broadband services, or treated those like we used to treat the postal service, but as for the actual postal service, keeping it public might be unnecessary -- it might be okay for us to give it up to the private sector, let them drop the slack, pick up what's profitable, and say, ""yeah, we don't care, let them do whatever they want.""

It takes time. It's easier for some than others. I do agree, see a doctor just in case. But I doubt you actually have phimosis given that you are able to pull it back part of the way without discomfort. The hivemind on reddit is often quick to jump to extremes. I learned this in a post I put up here a long while ago.

Practise while flacid for the time being, slowly **and I mean slowly** retract the foreskin all the way back, keep it there a few minutes and take that opportunity to give it a proper clean as well. You should experience at first a sort of burning sensation, likened to a ""indian burn"" around your foreskin, but after time it will go away. Phimosis is a condition which you'd have likely discovered much, much earlier than this. Your foreskin, had it been that tight, would likely have caused you pain during your usual cleaning process as it has been. Also, the answer, almost always, when it comes to Phimosis is circumscision. The fact that you have some ability to retract tells me this would be an unnecessary operation with, for you atleast, adverse effects (that is regarding sensitivity, relearning how to piss standing up haha)."

I was 16 years old then, sitting around my neighbors house when he pulled out his pipe and the first marijuana I'd ever seen, and shortly thereafter, smoked. I loved it. At first it was the way it made everything more interesting. Then it just became habit. Somewhere along the way I became a pot head. I got high every day for the last 25 years. I can honestly say that I did not go a day without smoking in 25 years. I gave up a lot of other things along the way. I began drinking alcohol, drank a lot and then quite cold turkey without a problem. I had issues with cocaine but quite that cold turkey, too, without a problem. I was a cigarette smoker for 15 years but one day, when I coughed up something too black and too nasty to describe, I quite that cold turkey too. But try as I might (and I didn't try very hard) I could not stop smoking pot. I loved it. I loved getting high and it was what I wanted to do every night when I came home from work and every weekend when I woke up. I loved to just hang out at home on a Friday night and rip tubes, content not to go anywhere. No, pot had nothing to do with my desire not to go anywhere (as in out on the town) as I've always been a homebody and not much of a nightlife person. I found I enjoyed being home alone with some smoke, just me and the cats and some bong hits. I was happy. I spent a lot of money on a weekly basis keeping that habit up. I spent 120 per quarter, going through at least a quarter a week and now, at the point where I've finally given up, I'm down to a 10 dollar a day habit, which even at that little amount has managed to break me down, financially. So what is the point of all this? Am I trying to instill a lesson in you young smokers out there? No, not really. I don't care if you smoke until you're sixty, I'm not on a crusade to change anybodies view on pot. I'm just saying ""I'm done"" because ultimately I'm just bored with pot and it costs too much money and frankly I'm tired of getting high only to come right back down again. I'm tired of hooking up with ""the man"" for the chrondo every week. I'm tired of nasty black shit on my hands when I clean my bong and while we're at it, I'm tired of my bong. Mostly I'm tired of being a 40something pot head. I quit. I'm ready for what comes next in life, after pot. I don't know what it is but I'm sure it's not a recreational drug. I'm finished. I'm sober from here on out, for the rest of my days, I can just sense it. Old drug addicts don't always die, sometimes they just burn out. I've burnt out. I'm done. Adios, 420, I fucking loved you for so long, but that's the news and I am outta here. Smoke 'em if ya' got 'em, for me, Reddit/MJ. I tip my cap to you and gracefully bow out. I'm gone."
